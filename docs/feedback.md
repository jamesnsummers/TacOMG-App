**Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:**

* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

**Meets Expectations - You have delivered a project that met all the technical requirements**

* **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element to your project? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

**Exceeds Expectations - Your site is very unique and a lot of thought was put into the design.  Great job!**

* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

**Meets expectations - You followed best practices with code organization. Given more time, I would expect to see all code neatly tucked away to their intended locations.**

* **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? *(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)*

**Exceeds Expectations - Your project had the unique challenge of handling votes; I gave you the extra challenge of attempting to make secure voting by only allowing a user to vote for one taco once; while this proved very difficult, you persevered and were still able to divide your efforts to accomplish your other user stories. This is an authentic, original, and creative project. -JC**

You'll be receiving written feedback from your instructors as well has having in-line comments inside your code. Each of the criteria above will be evaluated as one of **incomplete**, **does not meet expectations**, **meets expectations**, or **exceeds expectations**.
